Nowadays, heart disease can be regarded as one of the most fatal diseases in the world. And nearly 647,000 Americans die from heart disease every year. Thus, developing an ML model to detect and predict heart disease may help the patients get effective treatment at the early stage, significantly reducing the probability of causing death. To build the model, we decide to use a dataset that measures the possible indicators that cause heart disease like high blood pressure, alcohol, or smoking. By evaluating these indicators, we may be able to predict whether an individual has heart disease. CDC collects the data in the dataset through telephone surveys, including the health status of US adults in over 50 states. And before building the ML model, we will firstly preprocess the data, converting them into appropriate data types and abandoning some features if needed. After the model is created, we will use some metrics or criteria to evaluate its accuracy, determining whether it is a successful model.
